# Wildfire-Detection
This project focuses on detecting wildfires using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to analyze environmental data and identify potential wildfire occurrences to enable faster response and mitigation.
Project Overview

Wildfires cause severe ecological and economic damage. Early detection is crucial to minimize losses. In this project, we:
- Preprocess environmental data
- Visualize key variables
- Train a machine learning model to detect wildfires
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

Files Included
- `Wildfire Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix
